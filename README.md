# Industrial-Organization-Buyout-PhD

This repository contains materials for an assignment completed as part of a PhD-level Industrial Organization course. The assignment, designed by the course professor, involves generating and analyzing data for a hypothetical brewery industry. The primary focus of the assignment are:
- **Generating Data**: Using a random coefficient model to simulate market in a hypothetical brewery industry.
- **Model Estimation**: Applying a nested logit model to estimate the simulated data and assess potential misspecifications.
- **Post-Buyout Simulation**: Simulating the market effects of a brewery acquiring another brewery within the industry.

The repository contains the following files:
1. **buyout_simulation_Q.pdf**: This file provides a detailed description of the problem, the market structure, and the steps required to complete the assignment.
2. **buyout.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing all the simulations, including data generation, nested logit estimation, and post-buyout scenario analysis.
3. **buyout_report.pdf**: The main submission file that answers the questions outlined in _buyout_simulation_Q.pdf_, using the simulations and analyses from _buyout.ipynb_.
